Controls: mouse for pitch/yaw and roll based on it, W/S to increase throttle, A/D for strafe (is pretty minimalistic tho :D), Q/E for custom roll, Shift for nitro boost.

01/09/2022 update: been playing with shader graph and VFX graph for a couple days: tried to get some toonish lighting, hologram appearance for waypoints, stylized projectiles and engine flames
